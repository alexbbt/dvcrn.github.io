Hi, I'm a Software Engineer curently living in Japan. Check out my [github](https://github.com/dvcrn) and make sure to hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davicorn).

This blog is my personal braindump when it comes to technology, programming and more. For less dumpy posts that are a bit more thought-through, check out my [Medium](https://medium.com/@DavidMohl).

Wanna talk business? Contact me [here](mailto:me@dave.cx).
